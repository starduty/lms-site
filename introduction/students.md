Using Instructure Canvas


Keep it simple.

We get it. You don't want confusion. You don't want incompatibility. You don't want downtime. You don't want technology from 1998. You want technology that makes your school life easier. You want things like an intelligent course calendar, class notifications without logging in, and easy online submission for any assignment. In short, you want an LMS that works for you.


Easy as browsing the web.

Instructure Canvas is built using the same technology that your favorite websites are built with. It has all the reliability, usability, and responsiveness that you’ve come to expect from the best apps on the web.


Your Life: Easier.

Tired of fighting with technology to get your education? Finally, there's an LMS that makes getting through school easier - not harder. The Canvas LMS offers easy-to-use communication tools, a simple dashboard page that gives you a comprehensive overview of all your classes, a what-if-scenario grade calculator, and a wide array of notification options so that you're alerted whenever something in one of your classes changes.

The point is this: you'll finally be able to see your LMS as a tool, not an obstacle.


Communicate your way.

Your class has been canceled this week. How are you going to find out? You could check the class website, but let’s be honest - that’s a hassle. In fact, all you really want is a text or a Facebook message to give you the heads up. With Instructure Canvas, that’s no problem (and you don’t even have to friend your teacher).
