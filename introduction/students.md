We get it. You don't want confusion. You don't want incompatibility. You don't want downtime. You don't want technology from 1998. You want technology that makes your school life easier. You want things like an intelligent course calendar, class notifications without logging in, and easy online submission for any assignment. In short, you want an LMS that works for you.
