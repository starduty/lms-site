Modern Web Technologies

In the 1990s it was Java and in the 2000s it was PHP and .NET. The platform for Web 2.0 and beyond is Ruby. Some of the worldâ€™s easiest and most fun-to-use websites are built on this flexible, powerful and scalable technology: Twitter, Hulu, Basecamp, Github, Lonely Planet and Scribd. Canvas also leverages other modern technologies like HTML5, jQuery, OAuth, and numerous external service integrations. All of these high-performing best-of-the-web solutions, through Canvas, are here to help your educators and learners collaborate more effectively.
