Why Instructure Canvas?


Use your time for more important things.

Imagine using technology that made it easier - not harder - to educate. Instructure Canvas is designed with you, the teacher, in mind so you can view your LMS as a tool instead of a necessary evil. And whether it’s simple course management, seamless course calendaring, or just routine grading, you’ll notice a remarkable difference in your productivity and workflow.

In the end, Canvas is designed to help you get back to doing what you do best - teaching.


Stay in touch.

The way we communicate is changing rapidly with the rise of texting, social networks and real-time online chat. Instructure Canvas makes sure that you can communicate with students, other teachers, and administrators using methods and tools that are already familiar and effective for them. No need to become friends on a social network or learn complex new systems, just select the way you want to communicate and start a conversation.

Instructure Canvas integrates with email, Facebook, RSS, and Google, to name a few.


Experience the power.

Instructure Canvas is simple, yet powerful and can accommodate the beginner as well as the power user. The intuitive interface makes the experience feel familiar since many elements are patterned after successful interfaces that we all use on the web today.
