### The simple, open LMS from Instructure

> Canvas helps students and faculty feel more connected by building relationships in ways that other LMSs haven’t provided. Users collaborate more and function more like classroom groups. We believe it is going to dramatically improve our retention rates. —Ben Neiswender
